The objective of this project

I was asked to create a music song recommender based on the list of Billboard hot 100 and Spotify song features.
The songs were grouped into 11 clusters.
When the user is typing a song in, the system recognizes if the input is on a Hot song list or not.
If the song is hot, the user will get a recommendation of a song from the same cluster. 
If the song is not on the hot list, the system will show the user 3 randomly chosen hot songs for him to stay cool and trendy.
